    <p>
      Hi. My name's Ben. This is a simple voting app that I built following the Level Up Tutorials. <br />
      It uses Meteor as the build platform, MongoDB as the database, and React as the front end library. <br />
      I'm hoping to expand the app so that it can be used as a family trivia game over the holidays. <br />
      Feel free to check it out! (No profanity or obscenity please.)
